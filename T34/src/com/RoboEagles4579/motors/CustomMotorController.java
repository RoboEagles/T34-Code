/*
 * Property of FRC TEAM 4579 - RoboEagles
 * v1.0 | 03/19/2015
 * Lead Programmer, Jaden Bottemiller
 * 
 * This class is intended to be used to estimate the speed of the motor shaft
 * given a certain input of current to the motor controller. This is not intended for
 * applications requiring specific control of speed on the motor. E.G. This does not
 * completely replace a quaderature encoder.
 * 
 * It is required that you have your Power Distribution Panel connected to the RoboRio via CAN
 * in order to be used.
 * 
 * Updates for the next release:
 * 
 * - Methods for handling variable load (currently beta)
